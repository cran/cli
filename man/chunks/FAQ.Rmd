## My platform supports ANSI colors, why does cli not use them?

It is probably a mistake in cli's ANSI support detection algorithm.
Please open an issue at https://github.com/r-lib/cli/issues and don't forget to tell us the details of your platform and terminal or GUI.

## How do I turn off ANSI colors and styles?

Set the `NO_COLOR` environment variable to a non-empty value.
You can do this in your `.Renviron` file (use `usethis::edit_r_environ()`).

If you want to do this for testthat tests, then consider using the 3rd edition on testthat, which does turn off ANSI styling automatically inside `test_that()`.
