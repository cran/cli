\title{Determine the width of the console}
\usage{
console_width()
}
\value{
Integer scalar, the console with, in number of characters.
}
\description{
It uses the \code{cli.width} option, if set. Otherwise it tries to
determine the size of the terminal or console window.
}
\details{
These are the exact rules:
\itemize{
\item If the \code{cli.width} option is set to a positive integer, it is used.
\item If the \code{cli.width} option is set, but it is not a positive integer,
and error is thrown.
}

Then we try to determine the size of the terminal or console window:
\itemize{
\item If we are not in RStudio, or we are in an RStudio temrinal,
then we try to use the \code{tty_size()} function to query the
terminal size. This might fail if R is not running in a terminal,
but failures are ignored.
\item If we are in the RStudio build pane, then the \code{RSTUDIO_CONSOLE_WIDTH}
environment variable is used. If the build pane is resized, then this
environment variable is not accurate any more, and the output might
get garbled.
\item We are \emph{not} using the \code{RSTUDIO_CONSOLE_WIDTH} environment variable
if we are in the RStudio console.
}

If we cannot determine the size of the terminal or console window, then
we use the \code{width} option. If the \code{width} option is not set, then
we return 80L.
